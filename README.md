## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned the basics of Grids doing this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html

<div class="grid-container">

        <div class="grid-item grid-item-1"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">FAQs</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-2"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Privacy Policy</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-3"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Install Guide</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-4"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Contact Us</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-5"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Press Kit</a> </div>

    </div>

```
```css

.grid-container {

    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;
    position: relative;
    left: 130px;
    bottom: 120px;
    
}

```

### Continued development

I would like to learn a lot more about "Grids" and eventually learn to produce the same amount of code with less code. For example I had a issue aligning text to the left side in the footer, so what I did was just add width to grid-item-1 and grid-item-5. I also did this with a couple other elements such as paragraph tags. I don't want to do this again, I'm sure there is an easier way.

### Useful resources

- [Grids](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=grids+html+and+css) - This helped me to learn grids. I really liked this video and will use it going forward.
