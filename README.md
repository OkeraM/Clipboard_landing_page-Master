### What I learned

I learned the basics of Grids doing this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html

<div class="grid-container">

        <div class="grid-item grid-item-1"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">FAQs</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-2"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Privacy Policy</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-3"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Install Guide</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-4"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Contact Us</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-5"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Press Kit</a> </div>

    </div>

```
```css

.grid-container {

    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;
    position: relative;
    left: 130px;
    bottom: 120px;
    
}

```
