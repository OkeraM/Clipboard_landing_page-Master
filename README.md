## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I learned the basics of Grids doing this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html

<div class="grid-container">

        <div class="grid-item grid-item-1"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">FAQs</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-2"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Privacy Policy</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-3"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Install Guide</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-4"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Contact Us</a> </div>
        <div class="grid-item grid-item-5"> <a href="#" id="anchor_1">Press Kit</a> </div>

    </div>

```
```css

.grid-container {

    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;
    position: relative;
    left: 130px;
    bottom: 120px;
    
}

```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Grids](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=grids+html+and+css) - This helped me to learn grids. I really liked this video and will use it going forward.
